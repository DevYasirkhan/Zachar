            <p class="meet-left-text">
              Chris Zachar is a Phoenix-based personal injury trial lawyer. A
              graduate of Arizona State University (1989) and the University of
              Arizona College of Law (1992), he has been practicing law in the
              state since 1992. As a Board Certified Specialist in Personal
              Injury and Wrongful Death law, Chris is part of a very small group
              of attorneys—less than 2% statewide—who have achieved this
              specialized recognition by the Arizona State Bar. His practice
              includes all city, county and Arizona state courts, as well the
              United States District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
              and the US Supreme Court.
            </p>
            <p class="meet-left-text">
              A skillful litigator, Chris has earned a reputation for obtaining
              very favorable settlements and large verdicts for his clients in
              matters involving personal injury and wrongful death. Settlements
              can often be reached out of court, but when this isn’t possible,
              Chris brings the trial experience needed to argue and win your
              case in front of a jury.
