                It is a well-known fact that most cases settle. But, settle for
                what? Is the settlement the actual value your case is worth
                because you have hired the right personal injury lawyer in
                Arizona, who has put in the hours needed to prove your case and
                get you the personal injury settlement you deserve?
              </p>
              <p class="result-left-text">
                Or, is it a “take the best you can get” because you hired an
                attorney who talked a good game, but then did nothing, and as
                such, has to settle for the insurance company’s number?
              </p>
              <p class="result-left-text">
                Please understand this: Insurance companies know which
                Plaintiff’s lawyers are willing to litigate cases; they know
                which attorneys will try cases and how well they do it.
              </p>
              <p class="result-left-text">
                To get the best result for your case, you need an attorney with
                a reputable Phoenix personal injury lawyer who is willing to
                work and fight for you—with a proven record of trying cases –
                with excellent case results.

            <p class="story-description">
              In August 2017, “John” was at a bar in Old Town Scottsdale with
              friends, celebrating a special occasion. Their group was at a
              reserved booth in the VIP section. During the course of the
              evening, one of the group members discovered that someone from
              another table was stealing beers off of their table. A
              non-confrontational discussion ensued, but the bar’s jumpy and
              overly aggressive bouncers inserted themselves forcibly into the
              discussion almost immediately.
            </p>
            <p class="story-description">
              Even though John was only a bystander, and not involved in the
              discussion that was taking place on the other side of VIP booth,
              one of the bar’s bouncers grabbed him and physically hauled him
              from their booth, through the bar and outside. Once there, without
              reason, the bouncer slammed John to the ground, resulting in an
              injury to his shoulder that later required surgery. The bar
              refused to accept responsibility, so John retained Zachar Law Firm
              and a lawsuit was filed.
            </p>
            <p class="story-description">
              Fortunately for John, the entire incident was caught on the video
              cameras of a nearby establishment. Once revealed, the defenses of
              the at-fault bouncers and bar collapsed. The case was then settled
              favorably for John by Zachar Law Firm.

              Fortunately for John, the entire incident was caught on the video
              cameras of a nearby establishment. Once revealed, the defenses of
              the at-fault bouncers and bar collapsed. The case was then settled
              favorably for John by Zachar Law Firm.

            <p class="story-description">
              In August 2017, “John” was at a bar in Old Town Scottsdale with
              friends, celebrating a special occasion. Their group was at a
              reserved booth in the VIP section. During the course of the
              evening, one of the group members discovered that someone from
              another table was stealing beers off of their table. A
              non-confrontational discussion ensued, but the bar’s jumpy and
              overly aggressive bouncers inserted themselves forcibly into the
              discussion almost immediately.

            <p class="story-description">
              Even though John was only a bystander, and not involved in the
              discussion that was taking place on the other side of VIP booth,
              one of the bar’s bouncers grabbed him and physically hauled him
              from their booth, through the bar and outside. Once there, without
              reason, the bouncer slammed John to the ground, resulting in an
              injury to his shoulder that later required surgery. The bar
              refused to accept responsibility, so John retained Zachar Law Firm
              and a lawsuit was filed.
